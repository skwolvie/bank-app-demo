# Personal Notes on how to run: 
1. Git clone / Download Zip
2. open the project directory in terminal / vscode
3. Prerequisites (Chatgpt and set up the following):
   - Install Xcode
   - Install Git
   - Install Homebrew 
   - Install AWS CLI
   -    Configure AWS
   - Install Kubectl
   - Install Kubernetes
4. Login to AWS Console &
   - create an S3 bucket in us-west-1 (North Virginia). Name of bucket= banking-demo-terraform-state
   - create a dynamo DB table in us-west-1. Name of table= banking-demo-terraform-state-lock. Partition Key = LockID
5. Setup Infrastructure:
```bash
cd terraform/infrastructure
terraform init
terraform apply
```
6. Setup Application
```bash
cd ../application
terraform init
terraform apply
```
7. Setup Kube
```bash
cd kubernetes-manifests-new
kubectl apply -f .
```
8. Destroy Infrastructure
cd terraform/infrastructure
terraform destroy

9. Destroy Application
cd ../application
terraform destroy

10. Destroy Kube
cd kubernetes-manifests-new
kubectl delete -f .

# Bank of Anthos AWS Demo

This project is an AWS-adapted version of the Google Cloud Bank of Anthos demo application. It demonstrates a cloud-native banking application running on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

```

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform (version 1.6.6 or later)
- kubectl
- An AWS account with permissions to create EKS clusters

## Setup and Deployment

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment

To deploy the AWS infrastructure run the Terraform Infrastructure Deploy pipeline or manually:


```bash
cd terraform/infrastructure
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 2. Application Deployment

After the infrastructure is set up run the Terraform Application Deploy pipeline or manually:

```bash
cd ../application
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 3. Kubernetes Manifests Application

Kubernetes manifests are applied automatically via GitHub Actions via the Apply Kubernetes Manifests pipeline. To manually apply the manifests:

```bash
cd kubernetes-manifests-new
kubectl apply -f .
```

## CI/CD Pipelines

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The following workflows are implemented:

### Infrastructure and Application Deployment

1. **Terraform Infrastructure Deploy** (`terraform-infrastructure.yaml`)
   - Applies changes to the AWS infrastructure when updates are made to Terraform files in the `terraform/infrastructure/` directory.

2. **Terraform Application Deploy** (`terraform-application.yaml`)
   - Applies changes to application-specific resources when updates are made to Terraform files in the `terraform/application/` directory.

### Microservices Image Building

3. **Balance Reader Image Build** (`balancereader-image-build.yaml`)
   - Builds and pushes the Docker image for the Balance Reader service.

4. **Contacts Service Image Build** (`contacts-image-build.yaml`)
   - Builds and pushes the Docker image for the Contacts service.

5. **Frontend Image Build** (`frontend-image-build.yaml`)
   - Builds and pushes the Docker image for the Frontend service.

6. **Ledger Writer Image Build** (`ledgerwriter-image-build.yaml`)
   - Builds and pushes the Docker image for the Ledger Writer service.

7. **Transaction History Image Build** (`transactionhistory-image-build.yaml`)
   - Builds and pushes the Docker image for the Transaction History service.

8. **User Service Image Build** (`uservice-image-build.yaml`)
   - Builds and pushes the Docker image for the User service.

### Kubernetes Deployment

9. **Apply Kubernetes Manifests** (`kubernetes-manifests-apply.yaml`)
   - Automatically applies Kubernetes manifests when changes are pushed to the `kubernetes-manifests-new/` directory.
   - Can be manually triggered to deploy to a specific cluster.

To manually trigger any of these workflows:
1. Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the desired workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Provide any required inputs (e.g., cluster name for Kubernetes manifest application)

These pipelines ensure that changes to any part of the application - from infrastructure to individual microservices - are automatically built, tested, and deployed.
